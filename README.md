# hello-world
This repository is to practice in GitHub and for activity 4.4 
I enjoy spending time with family and friends, reading, and I love animals. I live in Florida, and I'm excited to go back to school for this online program. I'm excited to learn and develop new skills, and I look forward to getting to know my classmates and professors in the program as well.
